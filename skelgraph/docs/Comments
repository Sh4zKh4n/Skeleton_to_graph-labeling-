This package skelgraph contains the most important scripts that I used during my internship.

- skeletonize.py : The module for the initial .h5 files preparation and skeletonization.

- skel_graph_transform.py : Creates skeletons as .h5 files, computes distance transform, creates NetworkX graphs from the skeletons.

- label_method.py : Contains all function that are necessary for skel_graph_transform.py.

- graph_vis.py : Visualization of the graphs. It also contains the function for break-ups detection.

- graph_analysis.py : All the processing of the graphs that I made (almost). There can be dificulties with input data because I tried
                      to collect all the experiments together. It is better to copy the necessary block and to redefine all the inputs.
